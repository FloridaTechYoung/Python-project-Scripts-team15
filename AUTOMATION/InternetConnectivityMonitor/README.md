# Internet Connectivity Monitor


## Overview

Hi, I'm Prince Khunt. I have developed this Python script, which periodically check internet connectivity and diagnose network issues. It automates the process of diagnosing and potentially resolving connectivity problems by performing various network tests and actions.

## Features

- Checks internet connectivity by pinging multiple websites.
- Diagnoses network issues such as DNS resolution problems, DNS hijacking, proxy blocking, and firewall issues.
- Automatically restarts Wi-Fi connections, if connectivity problems persist.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script using the command `python monitor.py`.
4. The script will periodically check internet connectivity and diagnose any issues encountered.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (install via `pip install requests`)
